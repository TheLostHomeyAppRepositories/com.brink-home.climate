Brink-Home App for Homey:
Welcome to the Brink-Home App for Homey! This application is designed to seamlessly integrate your Brink Climate System with Homey, providing you with easy access and control over your ventilation system through your home network and the internet.

Overview:
The Brink-Home App requires a Brink Climate System equipped with a Brink Home (emodule). This app has been reverse-engineered due to the lack of available API or SDK manuals from Brink. A special thanks to Lukas Samuolis for his pioneering work on a similar app for Home Assistant, which inspired this project.

Required: 
You must have a functional Brink-Home account, and your climate system needs to be connected and functioning with the Brink-Home portal. To set up Homey, simply use your live and working user account from the Brink-Home portal.
This app is tested and does support the following models: Brink Flair en Renovent.

We hope you find the Brink-Home App for Homey useful and convenient for managing your home's climate system!
