# Brink-Home App for Homey
Welcome to the Brink-Home App for Homey! This application is designed to
seamlessly integrate your Brink Climate System with Homey, providing you with easy
access and control over your ventilation system through your home network and the
internet.

# Overview
The Brink-Home App requires a Brink Climate System equipped with a Brink Home
(emodule). This app has been reverse-engineered due to the lack of available API or
SDK manuals from Brink. A special thanks to Lukas Samuolis for his pioneering
work on a similar app for Home Assistant, which inspired this project.

# Features
Monitor Climate System
- Filter Status: Keep track of your filter's condition.
- Operating Mode: Check the current mode of your climate system.
- Fan Speed: Monitor the speed of your ventilation fan.
Control Climate System
- Operating Mode: Change the operating mode as needed.
- Fan Speed: Adjust the fan speed to your preference.
- Boost Mode: Set a custom time interval for the Boost button to quickly
enhance ventilation.

# Simplicity and Functionality
This app is designed with simplicity in mind, focusing on providing essential
operational information and remote control capabilities. It does not support additional
devices like CO2 sensors or external valves. For detailed insights and historical data,
please refer to the Brink-Home portal.

# Example Use Cases
- Automated Humidity Control: Pair with a low-cost humidity sensor like the
Aqara Temperature and Humidity sensor to automate fan speed adjustments
when humidity levels are high, such as during a shower.
- Remote Control Integration: Eliminate the need for additional Brink remote
controls by using any Homey-connected device. For example, configure a
Fibaro Dimmer 2 in the kitchen to set the fan speed to high for 30 minutes
with a double press.
- Maintenance Notifications: Receive alerts when it's time to clean or replace
your filter.
- Holiday Mode: Put your climate system in holiday or suspend mode when no
activity is detected.

# Notes
- This app is intended for basic functionality to operate and monitor your climate
system. For more detailed information and additional device support, please
use the Brink-Home portal.
- Required: You must have a functional Brink-Home account, and your climate
system needs to be connected and functioning with the Brink-Home portal. To
set up Homey, simply use your live and working user account from the Brink-
Home portal.

We hope you find the Brink-Home App for Homey useful and convenient for
managing your home's climate system!
